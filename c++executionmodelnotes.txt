Program is compiled into binary executable which is not in readable format

binary format is more understood by the cpu, the cpu loads and handles the program

RAM is random access memory not memory of hard drive, binary file is loaded into RAM

only then the cpu will run the program statement by statement

must allocate space for integers

for declarations it just stores some random value

funciton and its params lives in a different space then variables in ram, cpu knows return address of a function so it

knows where to come back after running function, cpu optimizes fx cals and odenst need to jumpo to perform them, can 

do them inline at a memory address since it knows the memory address of the fx declaration
