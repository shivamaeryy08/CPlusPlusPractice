#include <iostream>

// every var has an address value in memory

// int * means a pointer to an int whcih is the address value of a var

// can have pointers to custom types or any type 

int main () {
// declare pointer

int *random_pointer{}; // stores address of a variable type int, here pointers are initialzied to nullptr
// below is more explicit

// initialize to nullptr, means pointers are pointing to nothing
int *pointer_to_null{nullptr};

// all pointers of any type have the same size, since they all store addresses

//
